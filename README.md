# group_2
CS122 group project

This project hopes to analyse gender disparity across academic disciplines and institutions. We will scrape authorship data from journal websites and article search engines, assign gender to author names, and analyse the distribution of gender in specific academic disciplines, institutions, and geographic regions.
