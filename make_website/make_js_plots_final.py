'''
This codes writes a javascript file, and was used to make part of java_functions_final.js, which was then edited further

This code opens the plots.txt file, which is a text file I made from the terminal 
that has the names of all of the files in pyplot_html_final. I then make it a string list of file names called
htmls. Then I extract the part of the html that is javascritpy and write that as a function to a javascirpt file, 
with the function name the name of the html file, and the <div id>s as the correct placeholders to correspond 
to my <div id>s in website.html

    htmls = myfile.read().split()

    '''

    javascript, end = rest.split("</script>")
